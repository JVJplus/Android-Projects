# Book Listing App
I got this project as an assignment on udacity online course.

This app takes book name as input from user and display list of related books fetching online from Google Books API. 

## Additional Features

1) **SeekBar** to select how many list of books to display on result.
2) **CheckBox** to select Whether user want to see single color or multiple color based on ratings of book.
3) **Abstract Background** to add visual polish.
4) Generating **Random** Word.

## What I Learnt
1) Using Async Task To Load JSON Data from API.
2) Display Data Using List View Adapter.
3) Adding Additional Libraries into App.
4) Loading Image using Glide Library.
5) **Debugging** Skills!! :P
